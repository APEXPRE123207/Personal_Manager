## 🔄 Next Steps

### Recommended (Optional Improvements):

1. **Optimize Launcher Icons** (for better quality):
   - Open Android Studio
   - Right-click `app/src/main/res`
   - Select: New → Image Asset
   - Choose logo.png as source
   - Generate properly sized and optimized icons
   - This will create adaptive icons for Android 8.0+

2. **Add Adaptive Icons** (Android 8.0+):
   - Create separate foreground and background layers
   - Allows for more dynamic icon animations
   - Better integration with different launchers

3. **Optimize Logo File Size**:
   - Consider compressing logo.png (currently 633KB)
   - Recommended: < 100KB for drawable resources
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Clean and rebuild the project
- [ ] Install on a device/emulator
- [ ] Verify "FLOW" appears as app name
- [ ] Check launcher icon displays correctly
- [ ] Confirm splash screen shows logo
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows "FLOW Dashboard"

## 📝 Notes

- The current launcher icons are direct copies of logo.png
- Android will auto-scale them, but quality may vary
- For production, consider using Android Studio's Image Asset Studio
- The logo has been applied but not optimized for each density
- Adaptive icons (mipmap-anydpi-v26) still use default templates

## 🎉 Result

- ✅ App name updated
- ✅ Custom logo on splash screen
- ✅ Launcher icons replaced
- ✅ Dashboard branded
- ✅ Professional taglines added

The app maintains all previous functionality while presenting a fresh, unified brand identity.
