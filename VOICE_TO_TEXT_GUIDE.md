# Voice-to-Text Feature Guide

## üé§ Implementation Overview

The voice-to-text feature has been fully implemented in the **NoteDetailScreen** with proper permission handling and error management.

## üìã How It Works

### 1. **Permission Flow**
```
User clicks mic button
    ‚Üì
Check if RECORD_AUDIO permission granted
    ‚Üì
If NOT granted ‚Üí Request permission
    ‚Üì
If granted ‚Üí Launch speech recognizer
```

### 2. **Speech Recognition Flow**
```
Speech recognizer launched
    ‚Üì
User speaks
    ‚Üì
Speech converted to text
    ‚Üì
Text intelligently appended to note body
    ‚Üì
Success toast shown
```

### 3. **Error Handling**
- **Permission Denied**: Shows toast explaining microphone permission is required
- **Speech Recognition Unavailable**: Shows toast that feature is not available on device
- **User Cancels**: Shows toast that recognition was cancelled
- **Success**: Shows "Text added!" confirmation

## üîß Technical Details

### Permissions Required
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```
Added in `AndroidManifest.xml`

### Key Components

#### 1. Permission Launcher
```kotlin
val permissionLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(
    contract = ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission(),
    onResult = { isGranted -> ... }
)
```

#### 2. Speech Recognition Launcher
```kotlin
val speechRecognizerLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(
    contract = ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult(),
    onResult = { result -> ... }
)
```

#### 3. Start Voice Recognition Function
```kotlin
fun startVoiceRecognition() {
    // Check permission
    // If granted ‚Üí launch speech recognizer
    // If not ‚Üí request permission
}
```

### Smart Text Insertion
The feature intelligently handles text insertion:
- **Empty note**: Inserts spoken text directly
- **Existing text**: Appends with a space separator

```kotlin
body = if (body.isBlank()) {
    spokenText
} else {
    "$body $spokenText"
}
```

## üéØ User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- **Mic button**: Primary-colored icon in top app bar
- **Tooltip**: "Voice to Text" content description
- **Feedback**: Toast messages for all states

### User Flow
1. User opens a note (new or existing)
2. Clicks the microphone icon in the top bar
3. If first time: Grants RECORD_AUDIO permission
4. Speaks into the device
5. Text appears in the note body
6. Can repeat as many times as needed
7. Saves note with combined text

## üì± Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: First-Time Use
1. Fresh install or clear app permissions
2. Create/open a note
3. Click mic button
4. **Expected**: Permission dialog appears
5. Grant permission
6. **Expected**: Speech recognition starts

### Test Case 2: Normal Use
1. Open a note with permission already granted
2. Click mic button
3. **Expected**: Speech recognition starts immediately
4. Speak a sentence
5. **Expected**: Text appears in note body with "Text added!" toast

### Test Case 3: Permission Denied
1. Deny RECORD_AUDIO permission
2. Click mic button
3. **Expected**: Toast says "Microphone permission is required for voice-to-text"

### Test Case 4: Device Without Speech Recognition
1. Test on emulator or device without Google Speech Services
2. Click mic button (with permission granted)
3. **Expected**: Toast says "Speech recognition is not available on this device"

### Test Case 5: User Cancels
1. Click mic button
2. Cancel the speech recognition dialog
3. **Expected**: Toast says "Speech recognition cancelled"

### Test Case 6: Multiple Additions
1. Click mic ‚Üí speak ‚Üí text added
2. Click mic again ‚Üí speak more ‚Üí text appended
3. **Expected**: Both spoken texts appear with proper spacing

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Requires Google Services**: Speech recognition requires Google Play Services
2. **Internet Connection**: Some devices need internet for speech recognition
3. **Language**: Currently set to "en-US" (can be customized)
4. **Accuracy**: Depends on device microphone quality and background noise

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Language Selection**: Let users choose speech recognition language
2. **Continuous Listening**: Option to keep mic open for continuous dictation
3. **Punctuation Commands**: "period", "comma", "new line" commands
4. **Offline Mode**: Implement offline speech recognition
5. **Custom Wake Word**: "Hey Manager" to activate voice input
6. **Voice Commands**: "Save note", "delete last sentence", etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Permission keeps getting requested
**Solution**: Check if permission is declared in manifest

### Issue: Speech recognition doesn't work
**Solution**: 
- Verify Google Play Services is installed
- Check internet connection
- Verify microphone hardware works

### Issue: Text appears garbled
**Solution**:
- Speak more clearly
- Reduce background noise
- Check device microphone

### Issue: App crashes on mic button click
**Solution**:
- Check manifest has RECORD_AUDIO permission
- Verify try-catch is in place for startVoiceRecognition
