# Duplicate Resources Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
You were getting a "duplicate resources" error because the mipmap folders contained BOTH:
- **ic_launcher.png** (your new FLOW logo)
- **ic_launcher.webp** (the old default Android launcher icons)

Android sees both `.png` and `.webp` versions of the same resource name (`ic_launcher`) as duplicates.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Removed all `.webp` launcher icon files** from the following directories:
- `mipmap-mdpi/`
- `mipmap-hdpi/`
- `mipmap-xhdpi/`
- `mipmap-xxhdpi/`
- `mipmap-xxxhdpi/`

### Files Deleted (10 total):
1. ❌ `ic_launcher.webp` (5 files - one per density)
2. ❌ `ic_launcher_round.webp` (5 files - one per density)

### Files Retained (10 total):
✅ `ic_launcher.png` (5 files - your FLOW logo)
✅ `ic_launcher_round.png` (5 files - your FLOW logo)

## Current State

### Each mipmap folder now contains only:
```
mipmap-mdpi/
  ├── ic_launcher.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
  └── ic_launcher_round.png (633KB - FLOW logo)

mipmap-hdpi/
  ├── ic_launcher.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
  └── ic_launcher_round.png (633KB - FLOW logo)

mipmap-xhdpi/
  ├── ic_launcher.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
  └── ic_launcher_round.png (633KB - FLOW logo)

mipmap-xxhdpi/
  ├── ic_launcher.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
  └── ic_launcher_round.png (633KB - FLOW logo)

mipmap-xxxhdpi/
  ├── ic_launcher.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
  └── ic_launcher_round.png (633KB - FLOW logo)
```

### Adaptive Icons (Android 8.0+):
The `mipmap-anydpi-v26/` folder still contains XML files that reference the launcher icons:
- `ic_launcher.xml` ✅
- `ic_launcher_round.xml` ✅

These XML files will automatically use the `.png` versions of your logo.

## Next Steps

### 1. Clean Build (REQUIRED)
In Android Studio:
- **Build** → **Clean Project**
- **Build** → **Rebuild Project**

Or via terminal:
```powershell
cd w:\GIT\PersonalManager
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat build
```

### 2. Invalidate Caches (Recommended)
In Android Studio:
- **File** → **Invalidate Caches / Restart...**
- Select **Invalidate and Restart**

### 3. Run the App
- Install on device/emulator
- The duplicate resource error should now be resolved ✅

## Why This Happened

Android Studio creates default launcher icons in `.webp` format (smaller file size). When we added your logo as `.png` files with the same name (`ic_launcher`), Android detected both formats as the same resource, causing a conflict.

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
1. Always check for existing launcher icon files before adding new ones
2. Delete old formats when replacing launcher icons
3. Use Android Studio's **Image Asset Studio** which automatically handles this:
   - Right-click `res` → **New** → **Image Asset**
   - It replaces all old icons automatically

## Verification

After cleaning and rebuilding, verify:
- [ ] No duplicate resource errors
- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] FLOW logo appears as app icon on device
- [ ] Splash screen shows FLOW logo
- [ ] App name shows as "FLOW"

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The duplicate resources error has been fixed by removing the conflicting `.webp` files. Your FLOW logo is now the only launcher icon in the project.
