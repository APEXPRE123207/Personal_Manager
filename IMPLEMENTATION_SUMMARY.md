## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Sync Gradle Dependencies**: 
   - In Android Studio, click "Sync Now" in the Gradle notification banner
   - Or run: `./gradlew build` from terminal
   
2. **Grant Runtime Permissions**:
   - When testing on a device, grant camera and storage permissions when prompted
   
3. **Test Features**:
   - Test photo attachment when adding transactions
   - Verify dashboard displays correct data
   - Check that pie charts render correctly
   - Verify navigation works from dashboard quick actions

## Notes

- The implementation uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` for database updates, so existing data may be lost during the upgrade
- For production, consider implementing proper Room migrations
- Photos are stored as URI strings - consider implementing a file management system for production
- The camera functionality requires device camera permission and actual camera hardware
